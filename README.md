# Auralis
A python program designed to let the user talk to their locally hosted AI.

This is a Python-based voice-interactive AI assistant that utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies. The program allows you to interact with a local AI model (Dolphin Mistral) hosted via the Ollama API. You can speak to the assistant, and it will process your input and respond with speech.

## Features
- **Voice Input**: The assistant listens for your speech using your microphone.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: The assistant converts its response to speech and plays it.
- **Wait for Enter Key**: The program waits for the Enter key to be pressed before starting speech recognition, allowing more control over when the assistant listens.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-interactive-ai.git
   cd voice-interactive-ai
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
```

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```
Install the dependencies:

bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the Ollama API running locally with the Dolphin Mistral model available.

Run the program:

bash
```

python auralis.py

How to Use

Press Enter to start the program and allow the assistant to listen.
